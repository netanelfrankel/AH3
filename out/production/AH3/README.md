## 1. FizzBuzz
Problem statement:

Write a Java program that prints numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5,
print "FizzBuzz".
 
### Instructions
- Write a function fizzBuzz that takes an integer n as a parameter and prints the numbers from 1 to n based
on the conditions below:

	1. If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

	2. If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

	3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Implement the function in a way that it follows the given specifications.


Example
Input: n = 15
Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
